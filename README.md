Implemented live play-by-play results (score+outs if live) onto React.js webpage.
I only could find around 2.5 hours to attempt this problem-
so I apologize if my implementation is very limited. This
was my first time using a modern JS framework- so took some
reading to get caught up. The App.tsx and gamefeed.module.css
is where almost all of my work is.

Best,
